Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll

Twas brrillig and the slithy toves,
did gire and gimble in the wabe.

All memsy were the borogrvoes.
and the mome raths otgrabe.

Beware the jaberwrok, my son!
The jaws that bite the claws that catch 
beware the jub jub and the bandersnatch

He took his vorpal swaord in hand
long time the manxome for he sought
